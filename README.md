This code sets up the R environment for an NFL analytics workflow by loading key packages for data retrieval (nflfastR), data wrangling (dplyr, tidyr), machine learning (xgboost, caret), and visualization (ggplot2). It then pulls a full decade of play-by-play data (2015–2025) using load_pbp(), giving you a detailed, event-level dataset for every NFL game in that span. This structure prepares the workspace for tasks like feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation, building the foundation for more advanced predictive modeling or decision-analysis work.
